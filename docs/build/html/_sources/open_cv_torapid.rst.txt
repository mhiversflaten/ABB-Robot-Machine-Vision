==================

.. py:function:: create_robtarget(gripper_height, gripper_rot, cam_pos, image, puck, cam_comp=False)

    Complete a series of transformations to finally create a robtarget of the puck's position from an image.
    These transformations are based on the setup at the University of Stavanger, and with a specific RobotStudio setup
    (in regards to coordinate systems). This Pack_ file includes this setup.
